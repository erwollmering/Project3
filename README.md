## Project Title

"Economic Trends in Minnesota: A County-Level Analysis of Income and Unemployment (2019â€“2023)"

## Introduction

This project aims to analyze and visualize key economic trends across Minnesota's counties from 2019 to 2023, with a specific focus on Median Household Income and Unemployment Rates. By examining these indicators, the project will highlight regional disparities and evolving economic conditions, offering valuable insights into the financial well-being and employment landscape throughout the state.

## Project Desciption

This project investigates economic trends across Minnesota's 87 counties between 2019 and 2023, using data on Median Household Income and Unemployment Rates. Through interactive visualizations and comparative analysis, the project will identify shifts in income distribution and employment patterns over time. Special attention will be given to highlighting regional disparities and economic resilience, offering a clearer understanding of how different communities within Minnesota have experienced and responded to recent economic changes. The goal is to provide policymakers, researchers, and the public with accessible insights into local economic conditions across the state.
